# Retail-Management-System

The following System was developed by a team of 4 students as part of a our College course. The System was investigated, developed and demonstrated over the course of a 12 week period.

The system was deisned to imitate and improve upon the now insolvent Xtra Vision and HMV retial stores. Our System would assist in the management and physical distribution of DVDs and other similar products.

Our main aim as  a team was to provide some possible improvement that may have aided in avoided the collapse of both outlets.

## The Systems

The System was comproised of two parts, a software system designed to manage a database of DVDs locally at a store and a website that customers could interact with and use with relation to the physical store and its products.

### Local System
The local system was deisnged using JSP, HTML, CSS and MYSQL for the backend database.
