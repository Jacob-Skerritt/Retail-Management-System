# Retail-Management-System

The following System was developed by a team of 4 students as part of a our College course. The System was investigated, developed and demonstrated over the course of a 12 week period.

The system was deisned to imitate and improve upon the now insolvent Xtra Vision and HMV retial stores. Our System would assist in the management and physical distribution of DVDs and other similar products.

Our main aim as  a team was to provide some possible improvement that may have aided in avoided the collapse of both outlets.

## The Systems

The System was comproised of two parts, a software system designed to manage a database of DVDs locally at a store and a website that customers could interact with and use with relation to the physical store and its products.

### Local System
The local system was deisnged using JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MYSQL for the  database. Our System provided all of the standard CRUD Elements for DVDs and user accounts.
#### Features
- Ability to create and maintain a database of DVDs
- Search functionality to allow quick and simple navigation of the database
- A clean and tidy User Interface designed using web technologies
- Ability to create and manage user accounts
- The functionality to provide rental or purchases (purchasing functionality was not fully implemented with regards to actual purchases) and for users to track their purchase/order history


### Website
The website served as a quick and easy hub for customers to browse a stores selection of DVDs without requiring them to be physically present in the store, cutting down and the required effort for a user to find a product of their liking. The website was directly integrated into with the store and allowed users to see exactly what was in their local store.
#### Features
- The ability to browse a wide catalogue of movies
- User account creation and management
- Ability to view user purchase and order histroy 
- Functionality to reserve a movie online for pick up in store

## Disclaimer
The following software was developed using new technolgies (JSP) that the team had not worked with previously. This system was developed as a prototype and proof of concept and should not be used in a live environment.
